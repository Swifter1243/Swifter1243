## I'm Swifter!

I'm a developer/artist and I am most well known for my [Beat Saber](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284246) work. I mostly create tools and then use them to pioneer advanced modded levels. My latest project is [Extra Sensory II](https://exsii.totalbs.dev/).

Some of my technical skills include:
- Tools Programming
- Graphics Programming
- Gameplay Programming
- Video Editing
- Music/Audio Production
