## I'm Swifter!

I'm a developer/artist and I am most well known for my [Beat Saber](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284246) work. I mostly produce various tools for creating advanced modded levels. Right now I'm working on [Extra Sensory II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilXgDkORxl4).

Some of my skills include:
- Tools Programming
- Graphics Programming
- Gameplay Programming
- Video Editing
- Music/Audio Production
